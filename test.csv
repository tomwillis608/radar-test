Four key metrics,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"To measure software delivery performance, more and more organizations are turning to the <strong>four key metrics</strong> as defined by the <a href=""https://www.devops-research.com/"">DORA research</a> program: change lead time, deployment frequency, mean time to restore (MTTR) and change fail percentage."
Lightweight architectural decision records,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"Much documentation can be replaced with highly readable code and tests. In a world of evolutionary architecture, however, it's important to record certain design decisions for the benefit of future team members as well as for external oversight. Lightweight Architecture Decision Records is a technique for capturing important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. We recommend storing these details in source control, instead of a wiki or website, as then they can provide a record that remains in sync with the code itself. For most projects, we see no reason why you wouldn't want to use this technique."
